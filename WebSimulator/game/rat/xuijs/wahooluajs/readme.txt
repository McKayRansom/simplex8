an attempt at providing the wahoolua structure in js/rat for more easily porting wahoolua projects to JS.

everything goes under the wahoolua global.

multiple inheritence is cleaned up to be either single inheritance or "hasa" relationships.

I'm using wahoolua style function naming with a capital first letter.

all file names are lower-case to avoid the inevitable pain of filename mismatching in case-sensitive environments.
