This folder contains different "boot" js files that list all the rat files to load for a given configuration of rat, e.g. for a particular platform or usage.

This is primarily for generating concatenated/compiled rat.js files using our tools, which look at rat.load() calls.

Since we only use concatenated rat files in some cases (most notably, web and LE builds), we don't list all possible combinations here, just the ones we commonly use.

Keep in mind that you can use the rat tools to generate a completely custom and minimal build of rat based on what you actually use in your project.  The builds generated here are the more generic catch-all builds that people usually expect if they don't want to mess with tools or modules or loading or anything - they just want a rat.js they can include and run with.
